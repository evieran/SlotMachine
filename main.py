"""
Slot Machine Simulator

This module simulates a basic slot machine game where the player can bet on different lines and spin the slot machine. 
The game includes the following features:

- Constants for maximum and minimum bets, number of lines, rows, and columns.
- A predefined set of symbols with associated counts and values.
- A function to check the winnings based on the symbols, lines, bet, and values.

Constants:
    MAX_LINES (int): Maximum number of lines to bet on.
    MAX_BET (int): Maximum bet amount.
    MIN_BET (int): Minimum bet amount.
    ROWS (int): Number of rows in the slot machine.
    COLS (int): Number of columns in the slot machine.
    symbol_count (dict): A dictionary containing the count of each symbol.
    symbol_value (dict): A dictionary containing the value of each symbol.
